## **Assignments**

1. ### Create a repository named `reachout-your-last-name`. For example, `reachout-troy` for "Achilles Troy". Change commit author and email configuration to match your Github profile. And these 24-hour clock timings you see below should be timings of your two-hour effort you put in every day. The initial commit should contain a text file named "game-time-your-last-name" that looks like the example below:

```
game-time: 1500 - 1700
```
 
2. ### Push the repository to your Github.  

3. ### Clone `reachout-fluents` from fluentsinc. Create a workspace. Find the `group-chat` text file. Reply to the questions in there but first use your username like below so that everybody knows who's saying what: 

```
How are you feeling right now?
@achilleshelenatroy - On a scale of 1 to 10, I feel like I'm a God. 
```

4. ### Change your configuration list as usual to match your Github profile. Commit your answers you give above and the commit message should be "your-last-name-reachedout". Push the commits to Github.

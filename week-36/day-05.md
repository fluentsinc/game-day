## **Assignments**

1. ### You all should've received a commit with the message "help out" to your `reachout-[Github-Username]` repository. The "help out" commit creates: two folders, a .html page and a .css page.

2. ### The two folders you've received would be titled "help-[Github-Profile-Last-Name]". Add the two [Github-Profile-Last-Name] usernames as collaborators to your `reachout-[Github-Username].

3. ### Now your next job is to copy paste the lines of code from the file you've received on "help-[Github-Profile-Last-Name]" into the file with the same name in `reachout-[Github-Profile-Last-Name] repository of the other person and push commits. 

4. ### In the mean time, just as you are helping out the team, the team is also helping you out by fixing your files. When a team member doesn't commit your files from their `help-[Github-Profile-Last-Name]" in time, you can reach out to them by committing a text file with your questions or comments on their progress. 

5. ###  When the other two members of the team had committed the correct files to your `reachout-[Github-Username]`. Copy all the contents in `reachout-[Github-Username]` to your `[Github-Username].github.io` and push the commits. 

6. ### Navigate to `https://[Github-Username].github.io`. The team members should be able to see the following animations:

- ### Britano Zovial - You should see a beer tap with beer pouring out of it. 
- ### Ivy Daredevil - You should see a glitchy 404 page. 
- ### Ace Silverlight - You should see a guy sleeping on the cloud with a toy on his hands.

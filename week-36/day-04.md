## **Assignments**

1. ### Create a repository on your Github. The repository name should be "[Your-Github-Username].github.io". For example, for "Achilles Troy", the username is "achilleshelenatroy" so the repository should be named "achilleshelenatroy.github.io".

2. ### Commit all the files from `fluentsinc/livehtml` except `README.md` with the correct commit author name and email. Push the commit to Github.

3. ### Navigate to: https://[Your-Github-Username].github.io to make sure that you can see the live webpage. You should get a webpage like the one you see here: https://achilleshelenatroy.github.io/

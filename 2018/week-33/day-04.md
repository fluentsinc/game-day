## **Assignments**

### 1. Clone the game-day repository on Github to your local computer and see the game-day assignments from Visual Code going forward.  

### 2. Create two new repositories on your computer and create a workspace for each of them. The repository names should be: `mockups` and `dribble`. The workspace names should be `ux-mockups` and `dribble-space` respectively mapped to the repositories. So the `mockups` repository folder should be inside `ux-mockups` workspace and the `dribble` repository folder should be inside `dribble-space` workspace.

### 3. Create initial commits for each of the repositories. Use the snipping tool to create the screenshots. Post screenshots of the `git log` output in terminal showing the initial commit for each of the repositories inside the appropriate workspace. For example, in the screenshot below we can see the workspace name "GameDay", Git repository name "game-day" and the initial commit all visible:

## **Assignments**

### 1. Preview all the markdown files(.md files) in rookie-experiments using the "Markdown Preview Enhanced" extension in Visual Code.  

### 2. Previewing the markdown files on Visual Code and viewing the markdown files on Github is quite different. The difference is mainly formatting. You need to view the difference between the two by starting with `rookie-experiments/README.md`. See the difference by looking at the markdown files side by side. This assignment is here to _**hit the point home**_ that you need to preview the markdown files on Visual Code, not on Github.

## **Assignments**

1. ### Clone the repository named "test-repo" on fluentsinc to your computer. Create a workspace for the cloned repository. Change your commit author name and email to match your Github profile. 

2. ### `test-repo` is a fluentsinc organization repository. Hence, multiple contributors might contribute to it at any time. So perform a Git pull before you create any commits always.

3. ### Create a commit with the message "touched base - your-profile-name". `your-profile-name` should be your Github profile name, not your username. So it should be "Achilles Troy", not "achilleshelenatroy". The commit should contain the following change: add a line `### your-profile-name` to the README.md file. Your line should be below your @username mention. For example, the line `### Achilles Troy` should be below the @username mention `@achilleshelenatroy`.
